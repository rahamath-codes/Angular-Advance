## Contents

This repo is a collection of advanced Angular concepts. Each folder is a standalone project you can run and learn from:

### Life-Cycle-Hooks  
Demonstrates Angular component lifecycle hooks like `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngAfterViewInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, and others.

### Lazy-Loading  
A feature module-based example showing how to use Angular Router to lazy-load modules and improve app performance.

### ToDo-Observables  
A To-Do application built with RxJS Observables. Demonstrates reactive data flow using `Subject`, `BehaviorSubject`, and `Observable`.

### DI-Providers  
Examples of Angular's Dependency Injection system, including provider scopes at root, component, and module levels.

### Route-Guards  
Demonstrates route protection using Angular guards: `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `CanLoad`, and `Resolve`.

### firebase-crud  
A complete example of CRUD operations with Angular and Firebase (Firestore) using real-time database features.

### unit-testing  
Examples of unit tests using Angular TestBed, Karma, and Jasmine. Includes testing components, services, and mocking techniques.
