## Contents

This repo is a playground of advanced Angular concepts. Each folder is a standalone project you can run and explore:

### ðŸ”¹ Lifeâ€‘Cycleâ€‘Hooks  
Demonstrates Angular component lifecycle hooks: `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngAfterViewInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, and more.

### ðŸ”¹ Lazyâ€‘Loading  
A showcase of lazy-loaded feature modules with Angular Router for improved performance and modularity.

### ðŸ”¹ ToDoâ€‘Observables  
A Toâ€‘Do app built with RxJS Observables â€” demonstrates reactive data flow, `Subject`, and `BehaviorSubject`.

### ðŸ”¹ DIâ€‘Providers  
Examples of Angular Dependency Injection: service providers at root/component/module level and the use of `@Injectable`, `@Optional`, and `@SkipSelf`.

### ðŸ”¹ Routeâ€‘Guards  
How to implement router guards (`CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`, `CanLoad`) for protecting routes and handling unsaved changes.

### ðŸ”¹ Toy_Tracker  
A small demo app to track toy inventory or usage â€” includes routing, forms, and data binding.

### ðŸ”¹ assets  
Shared assets (images, JSON files) used across multiple demo projects for UI/mock data.

### ðŸ”¹ firebaseâ€‘crud  
CRUD operations using Angular + Firebase (Firestore): create, read, update, delete data with real-time updates.

### ðŸ”¹ unitâ€‘testing  
Unit testing examples using Karma + Jasmine: component testing, service testing, mocking dependencies, using `TestBed`.
